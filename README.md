# Superbolt Branding
Welcome to the Superbolt branding guidelines. Below is a living document outlining the usage restrictions of the Superbolt brand and related assets.

### Name
Our product is **`Superbolt`** - all in one word with a capital S. No other spelling or casing is correct.

### Logo
Our primary logo is horizontal with our logomark on the left and the stylized "superbolt" next to it. We also have the standalone bolt logomark/icon that can be used if space is an issue. These two are the only acceptable usages of our logo: either the full horizontal logo or the standalone bolt logomark/icon. Logos are provided in `dark #0C0E12`, `white #FFFFFF` and `primary #3FFFF3` - but if a different colour is needed you can re-colour the logo as you see fit.

### Colours
Superbolt doesn't have an official colour palette for branding other than a general sense of "dark mode", but our primary highlight colour used in UI elements like buttons and key interactive elements is a bright turquoise with the hex code `#3FFFF3`.

### Typography
There are no typography rules for branding purposes.
